## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sheils C, an aspiring software-engineer.

I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I also have knowledge of Git for keeping track of my projects. 

I have worked on several projects. My se_project_aroundtheus involves HTML, CSS and JS to create a webpage for users to post images of scenic locations around the US. It integrates with an API to store user data and location posts. My se_project_react incorporates HTML, CSS and React to create a webpage to suggest attire based on the weather. Users can add their own attire pieces for cold, warm and hot weather. The app connects to a weather API and the what-to-wear API built by me to store users and attire info. My se_project_express is the backend server app I built using my knowledge of Node.js and Express, for my what-to-wear API. My final_frontend and final_backend are for a frontened app for users to log their recipes and for the backend app that stores user and recipe data. Currently I am working on an app that allows users to log their guitar tabs.  

I have a background in Environmental Studies so in the future I hope to build software for companies that are environmentally-conscious. 
I am also passionate about food so I hope to build simple websites for restaurants to showcase their menus.
